Subject: [PATCH 2/3] build: fgetc returns int, not char.

Returning the value into a char is a mistake on all platforms, but is
particularly bad on RISC-V.  On that platform (like ARM) char is
unsigned.  Therefore EOF (-1) is returned as 255, and the subsequent
test 'c == EOF' ('255 == -1') fails causing an infinite loop.
